# EVE AI Agent

> **Landing-page source:** [`index.html`](./index.html). GitHub Pages is optional and is not currently a deployed product endpoint.

**Live instance:** [eveonline-ai.ru/app](https://eveonline-ai.ru/app) — the operator's public deployment. Open the browser workspace, link a character over EVE SSO, and try the market AI search; the UI and the agent are bilingual (Russian/English).

Self-hosted, chat-first AI assistant for EVE Online. Run it through the browser, Telegram, Discord DMs, or the terminal CLI; it combines local EVE SDE data, live ESI data, killboard intelligence, route planning, and a Responses-compatible model loop with tool calling.

The optional same-origin browser app uses the same backend agent and SQLite state. The project does not require Redis, Postgres, queues, workers, or webhooks.

## v4.1 public release

v4 turns EVE AI Agent into a durable multi-user agent service while preserving
the self-hosted single-process and SQLite architecture. v4.1 grows the browser
workspace into a full pilot hub:

- **Market workspace.** Regional order books from a local snapshot sweep, full
  SDE item cards, market history and alerts, and a natural-language AI item
  picker running a tightly budgeted tool loop on the shared admission/quota layer.
- **Live pilot profile.** Location-grouped assets appraised against the local
  order book, orders, wallet, clones, skills, and granted scopes — every block
  with its own freshness marker.
- **Per-user model settings.** Model (Sol/Terra/Luna), reasoning effort, and
  verbosity per user, applied across browser, Telegram, Discord, and CLI, with
  guest gating and honest usage accounting for subagents and compaction.
- **Community integrations.** Bounded tools with schemas verified against live
  responses: EVE Ref industry cost, item appraisal (local book with optional
  Janice), zKillboard pilot intel, and MutaMarket abyssal prices.
- **Transparency.** A public page shows real model tariffs and per-request
  token usage; re-login no longer loses linked characters, sessions, or chats.

The v4.0 foundation underneath:

- A root agent builds and maintains a dependency-aware plan, tracks required
  outcomes, discovers deferred tools, and keeps working until the requested
  result is completed or explicitly reported unavailable.
- Independent public research can be delegated to bounded read subagents. They
  receive only allowlisted public tool schemas and public numeric IDs—never chat
  history, private ESI data, credentials, or write capabilities.
- Direct tool calls, parallel public reads, local parallel batches, and optional
  Programmatic Tool Calling share validation, admission, deadline, cancellation,
  identity, and output-size boundaries.
- The browser chat now uses a durable asynchronous SQLite queue with idempotent
  submission, authenticated SSE plus polling recovery, explicit cancellation,
  per-user lane serialization, and bounded global concurrency for public traffic.
- Browser users can keep several EVE characters attached to one account, choose
  the active character, and grant only the ESI scopes they want. Consent is
  versioned and presented in Russian and English.
- OpenAI remains the default provider path. The fixed ModelHub
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint supports the same application-owned local tools
  and defaults to the bounded public read-subagent path.
- Public deployment controls now include Turnstile verification, trusted-proxy
  CIDRs, HTTPS/hostname validation, request and compute-unit limits, durable
  restart recovery, queue health, and sanitized terminal errors.

The release evaluation covers complex multi-stage planning, tool discovery,
parallel research, private/public data separation, cancellation, identity
changes, terminal completeness, and a 100-user coordinator load scenario.

For a public SSO callback, use HTTPS, set the callback URL exactly in the EVE Developer Portal, generate a strong `AUTH_SECRET_KEY`, give ESI a reachable operator contact, and keep `.env` plus `data/` on the host only. The detailed production checklist is in [docs/deployment.md](./docs/deployment.md).

## Capabilities

- **Perimeter live map:** an ego-centric graph of the systems around your pilot where the ring index *is* the jump distance, with live kill activity, explainable danger scoring, gate-camp detection, wormhole shortcuts, risk-weighted routing, and an agent chat that warns you unprompted — pursuit, camps on the next hop, and hulls that out-class yours.
- Natural-language Telegram and Discord assistant for EVE Online questions and workflows.
- Same-origin browser chat with anonymous sessions, conversation history, optional EVE SSO, and the same guarded agent/tool loop.
- Browser market workspace: regional order books, SDE item cards, market history and alerts, and a natural-language AI item search.
- Live pilot profile with local-book asset appraisal, orders, wallet, clones, skills, and per-block freshness markers.
- Per-user model, reasoning-effort, and verbosity preferences honored across browser, Telegram, Discord, and CLI.
- Community data integrations: EVE Ref industry cost, local/Janice item appraisal, zKillboard pilot intel, and MutaMarket abyssal prices.
- Durable multi-user browser execution with idempotent `202` acceptance, SSE/poll recovery, cancellation, per-user lanes, and bounded shared capacity.
- Dependency-aware root-agent planning, effective tool discovery, goal-ledger completion checks, parallel public reads, and sandboxed read subagents.
- EVE SSO linking for private character data, with scope-aware capability gating.
- Local SDE SQLite lookups for static game data such as systems, items, dogma, blueprints, and routes.
- Live ESI access for character, corporation, market, location, mail, skills, industry, assets, and related data when scopes are granted.
- Route planning with live danger analysis, killmail context, gate-camp signals, Thera/Turnur shortcut support, and monitor mode.
- D-scan, fleet, local, OSINT, current EVE-KILL REST/feed intelligence, EVE-Scout, and intel notes.
- Heartbeat notifications (mail, skills, wallet, industry, kills, and more) delivered to the chat where you talk to the bot.

```

Hard constraints:

- Single-process Node.js app.
- SQLite only.
- Telegram long polling only; no webhooks. Discord standard gateway connection.
- The browser app is explicit opt-in (`WEB_CHAT_ENABLED=true`), same-origin, and never receives provider or ESI credentials.
- Static game data comes from the installed local SDE SQLite snapshot; its build/load metadata describes that snapshot and is not a claim of current freshness. Live authoritative character/market data comes from ESI; public kill discovery comes from EVE-KILL.
- Private ESI access is isolated per user/chat and gated by `get_eve_capabilities`.
- The model must not see tokens, refresh flow, pagination internals, retry logic, or secrets.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.19+.
- npm.
- At least one bot token:
  - Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), and/or
  - Discord bot token from <https://discord.com/developers/applications> (no privileged intents needed; the bot works in DMs).
- EVE Developer application from <https://developers.eveonline.com/>.
- A provider API key for the selected `OPENAI_PROVIDER` (`openai` or `modelhub`).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <your-public-fork-url> eveai
cd eveai
cp .env.example .env       # fill in the tokens
npm ci
npm run setup              # download + load EVE static data (SDE)
npm run dev
```

Then open a private chat with your Telegram bot, DM your Discord bot, or set
`WEB_CHAT_ENABLED=true` and open `http://localhost:3000/app`.

For local EVE SSO callbacks, set the callback URL in the EVE Developer Portal to:

```text
http://localhost:3000/auth/eve/callback
```

## Required Environment

Minimum local `.env` values (enable at least one bot or the browser chat):

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...        # and/or DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...
WEB_CHAT_ENABLED=true
WEB_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
OPENAI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1  # optional: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
OPENAI_RESPONSE_STATE_MODE=stateless
OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=false
OPENAI_PROGRAMMATIC_TOOL_CALLING=false
OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT=auto
OPENAI_REASONING_MODE=standard
OPENAI_TEXT_VERBOSITY=low
OPENAI_RESPONSES_TIMEOUT_MS=90000
OPENAI_RESPONSE_LANGUAGE=Russian
EVE_CLIENT_ID=...
EVE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-random-secret
EVE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/eve/callback
DEFAULT_MARKET_REGION_ID=10000002
DEFAULT_MARKET_REGION_NAME="The Forge"
ESI_USER_AGENT=EVEAI/4.0 (+https://github.com/your-org/eveai; contact=you@example.com)
EVE_KILL_USER_AGENT=EVEAI/4.0 (+https://github.com/your-org/eveai; contact=you@example.com)
```

Generate `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Model defaults:

- `OPENAI_PROVIDER=openai` uses the official OpenAI HTTP/SSE endpoint. `modelhub` selects the fixed ModelHub OpenAI-compatible HTTP/SSE endpoint (`https://modelhub.my/v1`).
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (optional) overrides the provider's default API endpoint. Use it to route requests through any OpenAI Responses API-compatible proxy — for example, `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` for OpenRouter (supports Claude, Gemini, Llama, and others). Capability flags (truncation, programmatic tool calling, etc.) are inherited from the selected `OPENAI_PROVIDER`.
- The selected provider and its API key are process-wide operator settings. Browser users never provide or receive this key; each user gets an isolated opaque session and chat lane while requests share the configured concurrency and rate limits.
- `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol` is the quality-first default. Use `gpt-5.6-terra` for a capability/cost balance or `gpt-5.6-luna` for latency-sensitive, high-volume deployments. The `gpt-5.6` alias routes to Sol.
- `OPENAI_PROGRAMMATIC_TOOL_CALLING=false` keeps the default direct-tool path. Setting it to `true` opts into provider-entitled hosted programs for exactly nine bounded public-read tools: static counts, batch market prices, wormhole-type comparisons, Scout system searches, compact kill-activity summaries, market-history summaries, system-metric snapshots, doctrine summaries, and dynamic-item summaries. Restart after changing it. See [OpenAI integration](./docs/openai-integration.md) for schemas, budgets, exclusions, real smoke matrices, and rollback.
- `OPENAI_RESPONSE_STATE_MODE=stateless` is the default and rollback path. `server` reuses `previous_response_id`, requires `OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=true`, and falls back to canonical SQLite history if the provider state is missing or no longer matches its anchored assistant message.
- `OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=false` keeps provider-side Response logs opt-in. Set it to `true` to inspect requests in [OpenAI Responses Logs](https://platform.openai.com/logs?api=responses); storage alone does not switch the state mode.
- `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT=auto` preserves EVE Agent's goal-based `low|medium|high` routing. Set `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` to override it globally.
- `OPENAI_REASONING_MODE=standard` is the normal path. Set `pro` only for difficult quality-first workloads that justify higher latency and token use; Pro is a mode, not a separate model name.
- `OPENAI_TEXT_VERBOSITY=low` keeps chat answers compact; set `medium` if your community wants longer explanations.
- `OPENAI_RESPONSES_TIMEOUT_MS=90000` controls the Responses transport deadline; raise it deliberately when evaluating Pro.
- `OPENAI_RESPONSE_LANGUAGE=Russian` sets the default final-answer language. Aliases like `ru`, `русский`, `en`, `English`, and custom language names are accepted; an explicit user request can override it per answer.

These are process-wide self-hosting controls shared by Telegram, Discord, and CLI. They are not per-chat preferences. See [OpenAI integration](./docs/openai-integration.md) and OpenAI's [GPT-5.6 guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model).

## EVE SSO Setup (private character data)

The current process configuration requires EVE Developer credentials at startup,
even if an operator initially uses only public data. Character linking itself is
optional: after credentials are configured, public SDE, market, route,
killboard, and OSINT workflows work without linking a character. To unlock
**private ESI** (skills, assets, wallet, location, mail, …), register a free
EVE Developer application (~5 minutes):

1. Open <https://developers.eveonline.com/applications/create> and sign in with
   your EVE account.
2. **Connection Type:** choose *Authentication & API Access*, then select the
   scopes you want to support (or all of them for full parity).
3. **Callback URL:** set it to *exactly* your `EVE_CALLBACK_URL`. For local use:

   ```text
   http://localhost:3000/auth/eve/callback
   ```

4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Secret Key** into `.env`:

   ```env
   EVE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   EVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

5. Restart. `/login` in the CLI and `/eve_login` in Telegram or Discord now
   return a working SSO link.

## Terminal CLI (no bot token needed)

Talk to the agent directly in your terminal — a third platform adapter beside
Telegram and Discord, driving the same runtime. It needs the same local `.env`
configuration as the app, but no Telegram or Discord bot token:

```bash
npm run cli
```

```text
┌─ EVE AI Agent v4.1.0 · CLI ────────────────────────┐
│ Talk to the agent in your terminal. Commands:      │
│   /login   link an EVE character (opens SSO)       │
│   /whoami  show the active character               │
│   /clear   wipe this conversation                  │
│   /version check project updates                   │
│   /exit    quit                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
eve> route from Jita to Amarr, is it dangerous?
```

Public tools (SDE lookups, market, route planning with danger analysis,
killboards, OSINT) work without a linked character. Run `/login` to link an EVE
character via SSO and unlock private ESI (skills, assets, location, mail, …).
The full bots still need a Telegram or Discord token; the CLI does not. While
the CLI process is open, `kill_watch` and route monitoring use the same durable
EVE-KILL feed lifecycle as Telegram and Discord. Their SQLite state survives a
restart and eligible route monitors are restored on the next CLI launch. Events
missed while the CLI is closed are not replayed. Heartbeat configuration remains
bot-service-only and is intentionally hidden in the CLI.

Only one bot service or CLI may own a given `DB_PATH` at a time. A DB-adjacent
runtime lock rejects a second process so two feed pollers cannot race the global
cursor.

While the agent works, the CLI shows a **live activity feed** — a brief
"thinking" note and one line per tool/skill as it runs (e.g. `🗄 SDE query`,
`💰 market prices`, `🛰 ESI · …`) — then renders the finished answer:

```text
eve> Сколько стоит Plex?
  💭 Checking PLEX price; resolve type_id, then market price
  🗄  SDE query · query
  💰 market prices · 1 item
PLEX: 4,621,543 ISK (global average — no regional order book).
```

This feed is CLI-only: the Telegram and Discord bots reply with one finished
message and are unaffected. The answer is rendered once from the finalized
(sanitized) text, not streamed token by token, so it is always clean and
complete.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run cli            # interactive terminal agent (no bot token required)
npm run dev            # tsx watch mode (recommended for running the bots)
npm run build          # compile server (tsc)
npm start              # run built app: node dist/app.js
npm run check          # typecheck + tests + lint
npm test               # vitest
npm run smoke          # env, model endpoint, app health checks
npm run smoke:openai   # authenticated provider-aware Responses probe
npm run smoke:eve-tool # authenticated model + EVE SDE tool probe
npm run eval:agent     # deterministic multi-stage orchestration evaluation
npm run eval:web-load  # 100-user durable queue/isolation load harness
npm run update:check   # read-only latest stable release check
npm run db:migrate     # run SQLite migrations
npm run setup          # download and load SDE data
```

On startup the app prints a status banner with database, SDE, HTTP, platform,
OpenAI, and heartbeat state. Structured logger output is timestamped and redacts
recognizable credentials; request-level diagnostics can still contain short user
goals, tool arguments, reasoning summaries, or provider-error snippets. Treat
process logs as private operational data.

## Runtime Smoke Test

Authenticated OpenAI smoke test:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... npm run smoke:openai
```

EVE tool smoke test:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... npm run smoke:eve-tool
```

For a DB-only SDE tool check without calling the model:

```bash
EVE_TOOL_SMOKE_MODE=direct npm run smoke:eve-tool
```

The scripts print only sanitized endpoint/model/tool metadata and answer previews. They never log API keys.
