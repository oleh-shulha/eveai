# Browser Chat And EVE SSO

Status: active

The optional browser app is a same-origin adapter over the same SQLite-backed
agent runtime used by Telegram, Discord, and the CLI. It does not call OpenAI,
the model endpoint, ESI, or any tool directly from the browser.

## Product Flow

1. `GET /app` serves the built React client when `WEB_CHAT_ENABLED=true`.
2. A user can create an anonymous browser session or connect an EVE character.
3. Every EVE login link first opens the bilingual consent form. The user may
   authorize identity only or select any subset of the allowlisted private ESI
   groups; write/action scopes are off by default.
4. The browser loads and creates conversations owned by that session.
5. `POST /api/web/chat` applies the shared in-flight, actor rate, and global
   concurrency guards before invoking the shared agent loop.
6. The configured process-wide endpoint and profile (`openai` or
   `compatible`) handle
   the model turn. The browser receives only the final answer and a bounded
   activity summary.
7. The same browser identity may repeat EVE SSO for multiple characters. The
   sidebar switches the active character and shows its conversations plus the
   pre-link guest threads. Linking a character already owned by another user
   merges the browser guest into that owner instead of failing, so characters
   from different EVE accounts use the same per-character flow.
8. `POST /api/web/characters/:characterId/unlink` revokes a character: it
   drops the link and, when no links remain, deletes the encrypted tokens and
   the materialized private character data.

The browser lane is request/response only. Background heartbeat, kill-watch,
and route-monitor tools are not exposed and `plan_route` never auto-starts a
monitor for a browser context; use Telegram, Discord, or the interactive CLI
for durable push delivery.

The provider token is the operator's server-side credential. It is never sent
to users, stored in browser storage, included in HTML, or returned by an API.

## Routes

- `GET /health`
- `GET /app` and `GET /app/*`
- `GET|POST|DELETE /api/web/session`
- `POST /api/web/eve/login`
- `POST /auth/eve/consent`
- `GET|POST /api/web/conversations`
- `GET /api/web/conversations/:threadId/messages`
- `DELETE /api/web/conversations/:threadId`
- `GET /api/web/characters`
- `POST /api/web/characters/:characterId/activate`
- `POST /api/web/characters/:characterId/unlink`
- `POST /api/web/chat`
- `GET /auth/eve/login?state=...`
- `GET /auth/eve/callback`
- `GET /callback` compatibility redirect

## Session And Isolation Boundary

- the session cookie is random, opaque, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and stored
  server-side only as a keyed hash;
- the separate CSRF cookie is validated with an exact same-origin `Origin`
  header and keyed server-side hash on every mutation;
- HTTPS deployments set both cookies `Secure`;
- browser chat IDs occupy a negative range disjoint from Telegram, Discord,
  and CLI lanes;
- every conversation read, mutation, and character activation checks both the
  internal user and browser chat lane;
- conversation lists and new threads are additionally bound to the active
  `character_id`, preventing a thread from one character from continuing under
  another; pre-link guest threads without a character stay listed regardless
  of the active character;
- a browser user may own several EVE characters; linking a character owned by
  another user folds the browser guest into that existing owner (lanes,
  conversations, market and usage data follow the surviving identity);
- `POST /api/web/characters/:characterId/unlink` revokes a character for the
  session user and, on the last link, deletes its encrypted tokens and
  materialized private data;
- anonymous-session creation is bounded per effective client IP before new
  rows reach SQLite;
- each browser lane is capped at 40 conversations, repeated new-chat requests
  reuse the same empty thread, and only one pending SSO request is retained;
- logout and expiry revoke only the browser session token for users with a
  linked EVE character: the persistent identity, its lanes, conversations,
  links, and encrypted EVE credentials are retained and reattached on the next
  SSO sign-in (orphaned lanes are folded into the signing-in lane). Route
  monitors are session-scoped and are discarded with the session. Anonymous
  guest lanes are purged transactionally — conversations, user-only links, and
  encrypted EVE credentials; a canonical Telegram, Discord, or CLI identity and
  its shared character ownership are retained;
- when a browser authenticates a character already owned by another channel,
  the browser lane joins that canonical internal user instead of transferring
  the character away from the existing channel.
- the one-time SSO request stores the consent version/language and the exact
  server-generated scope set; the callback rejects unacknowledged requests and
  any token that contains a scope outside that set.

`WEB_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` is an explicit allowlist of proxy socket peers.
Forwarded client-address headers from any other peer remain untrusted. A public
deployment must also prevent direct origin access at the network boundary.

## Provider Boundary

`OPENAI_PROFILE=openai` preserves the official OpenAI HTTP/SSE contract.
`OPENAI_PROFILE=compatible` assumes only the core of the Responses API and
selects client-side tool search plus bounded local parallel read batches; the
endpoint itself always comes from `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. Both modes enter through
the same application-controlled tool executor, private-data checks,
persistence, and rate limits. Profile and endpoint selection is not a per-user
browser option.

The consent screen names the configured provider because relevant private tool
results may be included in a model turn. EVE access/refresh tokens and provider
credentials never enter model input. See [eve-sso-consent.md](../eve-sso-consent.md).
