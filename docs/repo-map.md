## Root Entry Points

- `AGENTS.md`: shortest map plus invariants and deep links
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: system shape and request flows
- `README.md`: public-facing project overview
- `package.json`: scripts, package metadata, dependency surface
- `src/app.ts`: runtime bootstrap
- `src/config.ts`: env/config boundary
- `src/smoke.ts`: smoke-check entrypoint

## Runtime Domains

### `src/agent/`

- `native-responses.ts`: official OpenAI Responses API loop, including SSE function/MCP output reconstruction and fixed hosted-MCP descriptor support
- `executor.ts`: local tool execution, exact programmatic caller/coherence/work enforcement, validated opaque MCP continuation, and final-text persistence
- `programmatic-contracts.ts`: exact nine-tool allowlist plus strict bounded success/error output schemas and safe serialization
- `planner.ts` / `replanner.ts`: plan generation and adjustment
- `compact.ts`: history reduction and compaction
- `text-normalize.ts`: renders the LaTeX a model writes out of habit (`$
ightarrow$`) as the character it meant, outside code blocks only
- `prompts.ts`: prompt-policy boundary
- `finalizer.ts`: response shaping and final output path
- `tools.ts`: model-visible tool schema surface
- `tools/sde-execution.ts`, `tools/sde-schema.ts`: read-only SDE SQL validation/execution and prompt schema
- `tools/character-execution.ts`, `tools/character-sql-tool.ts`, `tools/character-schema.ts`: character_sql — read-only SQL over the synced private profile, isolated per active character through per-query TEMP views
- `firecrawl.ts`: the only path to an arbitrary web page — bounded Firecrawl search/scrape with a public-address guard, a content budget, and status-only error text
- `web-access.ts`: whether the web tools exist this turn — `.env` configuration plus the stored operator kill switch (`operator_flags`)
- `web-search.ts`: per-turn search/fetch budgets and the search fan-out (Firecrawl, optional Tavily, EVE University wiki)
- `market-context.ts`, `model.ts`: supporting runtime context

### `src/auth/`

- `auth-request.ts`: one-time EVE SSO state token storage
- `user-resolver.ts`: user/chat identity resolution (Telegram + Discord + outbound chat lookup)
- `secret-storage.ts`: encrypted secret persistence

### `src/chat/`

- `shared.ts`: platform-neutral chat pipeline — session rows, thread resolution, in-flight dedupe, rate limiting, agent turn, error normalization

### `src/messaging/`

- `outbound.ts`: platform-routing notification dispatcher (positive chat id -> Telegram, negative -> Discord)

### `src/db/`

- `schema.ts`: SQLite source of truth
- `migrations.ts`: in-place schema upgrades
- `sqlite.ts`: DB open/setup helpers
- `character-datastore.ts`: character_* table registry and lifecycle deletion (unlink/purge/ownership change)

### `src/eve/`

- `esi-client.ts`: native ESI transport and caching
- `esi-catalog.ts`: operation catalog derived from ESI spec
- `sso.ts` / `sso-auth.ts`: token refresh and JWT verification
- `capabilities.ts`: scope-aware private-access gating
- `sde.ts`, `sde-loader.ts`, `sde-downloader.ts`: static data ingestion and lookup; both loaders expose a callable entry point (`loadSdeIntoDb`, `downloadSdeArchive`) next to their CLI `main`
- `sde-source.ts`: identity of the upstream archive (ETag/Last-Modified/size), the `sde_meta` single-row snapshot, and the freshness comparison that never reads a size match as "current"
- `sde-refresh.ts`: the operator refresh job — download, reload, forced map-graph rebuild — single-flight per process
- `route-planner.ts`, `killmail.ts`: higher-level EVE features
- `eve-scout-client.ts`, `eve-scout-executor.ts`, `eve-scout-tools.ts`: fixed public EVE-Scout transport, bounded projections, and deferred tool schemas; see `docs/eve-scout.md`
- `market-history-summary.ts`: bounded 30/90-day public ESI market aggregation without raw daily rows
- `market-snapshot.ts`: the scheduled ESI order-book sweep (5-minute cron plus a jittered boot sweep), single-flight across both entry points, and the operator-forced sweep that zeroes the tier intervals while still honouring ESI's own cache window
- `system-mentions.ts`: which solar systems an answer names — exact, case-sensitive, standalone matches against the local SDE, so prose is not peppered with false links
- `market-wide-summary.ts`: whole-New-Eden live order-book sweep for one type across all SDE-derived k-space trade regions, with explicit coverage reporting
- `market-queries.ts`: read-only queries over the local `market_orders` snapshot with SDE joins — type search, overview/spread, paged order book, per-region comparison, market-group tree
- `market-type-info.ts`: full SDE item card for the web market — localized description, traits, grouped dogma attributes with units, required skills, meta-chain variations
- `market-history.ts`: local daily price history (`market_price_history`) with lazy ESI backfill and trend/volatility aggregates
- `market-history-worker.ts`: hourly cron worker draining due `(region, type)` history pairs (watchlist plus seeded top types)
- `market-alerts-worker.ts`: 5-minute cron worker firing one-shot price alerts against the local snapshot, with event log and outbound push
- `system-metric-snapshot.ts`: same-order projection of fixed public ESI system kill/jump/industry/sovereignty metrics
- `dynamic-item-summary.ts`: requested dynamic-dogma attributes plus optional local-SDE base/delta evidence without creator/effect leakage
- `user-profile.ts`: generated user snapshot/profile flow
- `character-sync.ts`: lazy TTL-based mirror of the private ESI profile (assets, wallet/journal, orders, contracts, skills, clones, standings, presence) into character_* tables
- `map-graph.ts`: Perimeter map graph derived from the SDE — `map_systems`/`map_edges`, jump-distance BFS with whole-ring node caps, and risk-weighted Dijkstra. Rendering coordinates prefer SDE `position2D` and fall back to the 3D position projected as `(x, -z)`; a build that resolves neither refuses rather than drawing every system at the origin
- `scopes.ts`, `eve-links.ts`, `http.ts`: support modules

### `src/eve-map/`

Perimeter live map. See `docs/product-specs/perimeter.md`.

- `bubble.ts`: per-frame assembly — local topology and activity, plus the hourly ESI baseline, sovereignty, and EVE-Scout wormholes, each with its own freshness marker and independent degradation
- `danger.ts`: explainable scoring — every score is returned as labelled terms, and it is scored for the pilot's actual hull
- `live-session.ts`: the only per-pilot ESI poll; runs solely while a stream is attached, one per character across tabs, capped, backed off, and drained on shutdown
- `advisor.ts`: deterministic rules that speak first, with per-rule cooldowns, repeat collapsing, and a separately rationed model escalation

- `gate-routes.ts`: `/api/web/gate` — the only endpoint a locked visitor may call: state, unlock, and lock again
- `eve-ui-routes.ts`: `/api/web/eve/ui` — hands one action to the running EVE client through ESI's UI endpoints (market details, show info, autopilot destination), plus `/api/web/eve/systems/resolve` for the system names an answer mentions; CSRF-checked, needs a linked character with `esi-ui.open_window.v1`, and answers `client_unavailable` when the client is closed

### `web/`

- `src/`: React chat client, safe Markdown rendering, responsive shell, and API adapter
- `src/components/MarketScreen.tsx` + `src/components/market/`: market browser — search, AI picker, group tree, order book, price chart, region comparison, item info tab, watchlist and price alerts with 60 s auto-refresh; SDE statics cached in-tab (`static-cache.ts`)
- `src/components/map/`: Perimeter — hand-written Canvas 2D renderer (`renderer.ts`), ego-ring and geographic layouts with an interpolated morph (`layout.ts`), follow camera and hit testing (`MapCanvas.tsx`), system inspector, route ribbon, freshness markers, and the agent chat panel (`PerimeterChat.tsx`). Uses only `d3-zoom`, `d3-quadtree`, `d3-scale`, `d3-interpolate`, and `d3-selection`; no graph library, because the layout is deterministic and a force simulation would destroy the jump-distance metric
