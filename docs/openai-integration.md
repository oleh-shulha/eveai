# OpenAI Integration

This project uses the OpenAI Responses API for a tool-heavy EVE Online agent loop.

## Default Target

- Model: `gpt-5.6-sol`
- Profile: `openai` or `compatible` (required, no default)
- Transport: both profiles use streamed HTTP `POST {base}/responses`
- Base URL: required, operator-supplied `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (e.g.
  `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
- Reasoning effort: `auto` (local goal classifier, with `medium` for internal calls)
- Reasoning mode: `standard`
- Text verbosity: `low`
- State mode: `stateless`
- Storage: `store=false` by default; `OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=true` opts into
  OpenAI stored Response logs
- Response timeout: 90 seconds

These defaults follow the current [GPT-5.6 guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model): use the Responses API for reasoning and tools, select a family tier by workload, set reasoning and verbosity intentionally, keep stable prompt content first for caching, and preserve output-item fields when replaying tool state.

`OPENAI_BASE_URL` is the single source of the endpoint: the runtime,
authenticated smoke, and aggregate smoke all resolve it, and no address is
built into the code. It is checked at startup only for what would otherwise
break or leak: an absolute http(s) API root, without embedded credentials,
query, fragment, or a trailing `/responses`.

`OPENAI_PROFILE` is an explicit capability contract for that endpoint, not an
address. Unknown IDs fail at startup. `compatible` covers any OpenAI-compatible
gateway reached over the same streamed HTTP `POST {base}/responses` transport:
it omits the optional `truncation:"auto"` field and `reasoning.encrypted_content`
because neither is guaranteed off the official API. Local bounded context,
pre-turn compaction, and mid-turn compaction still enforce the context budget.
Its client `tool_search` descriptor must match the expected wire shape exactly:
`type`, `execution`, `description`, and `parameters`.
Compatible stateless continuation therefore replays
function calls and outputs but filters reasoning items. The `openai`
profile keeps exact encrypted-reasoning replay unchanged.
Both profiles use the same HTTP/SSE Responses transport; the
codebase carries no second transport.

## Model And Reasoning Choice

The self-hosting operator selects one process-wide model:

| Value | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | Default, strongest capability and quality-first work |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | Strong capability with a lower-cost balance |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | Efficient, latency-sensitive, high-volume work |
| `gpt-5.6` | Family alias that currently routes to Sol |

`OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT=auto` is an EVE Agent policy, not an API value. It uses the existing goal classifier for top-level chat turns and resolves internal model calls to the balanced `medium` baseline. A fixed value (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`) overrides the classifier and reaches every normal chat turn unchanged.

`OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT_INTERMEDIATE` and `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT_FINAL` are opt-in per-iteration tiers on top of that base resolution. Both default to `auto`, which inherits the base effort and preserves single-tier behavior. The intermediate tier covers iterations that continue an in-flight tool chain (the previous response ended in tool calls whose outputs are fed back); the final tier covers the first request and continuations after plain assistant text. Set `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT_INTERMEDIATE=low` to cut reasoning spend on tool-selection steps while keeping the base effort for turn planning; unsetting the variable is the full rollback.

`OPENAI_REASONING_MODE=pro` sends `reasoning.mode="pro"` on top-level agent turns. Pro uses the selected family model; there is no separate `gpt-5.6-pro` slug. It increases latency and token use, so evaluate it on representative difficult EVE tasks and raise `OPENAI_RESPONSES_TIMEOUT_MS` only when the measured workload needs more than the 300-second default. Internal summarization, OSINT, and advisor calls stay in standard mode.

`OPENAI_TEXT_VERBOSITY` accepts `low`, `medium`, or `high`. The developer prompt keeps task-specific chat requirements; this API control supplies the default amount of detail.

End users can override the process-wide defaults for their own conversations on the web «Settings» screen (`GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/web/settings/model`, session + CSRF; `PUT` requires a linked EVE character). The per-user row in `user_model_settings` (keyed by `user_id`, so it spans the web, Telegram, and Discord lanes) carries one of the three verified model ids (`gpt-5.6-sol` / `gpt-5.6-terra` / `gpt-5.6-luna`), a reasoning effort from the same whitelist as `OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT`, and a verbosity. Users without a row run on the operator config; changes apply from the next turn. Usage events record the applied model, so the per-model tariffs on the transparency page price each event by the model that actually served it: top-level turns and delegated read-subagent calls inherit the user's model, while internal compaction summaries always run on — and are billed as — the operator-configured model.

## Response State Modes

`OPENAI_RESPONSE_STATE_MODE=stateless` remains the default and immediate
rollback path. The app rebuilds visible history from SQLite and sends each prior
`function_call` with its matching `function_call_output`.

`OPENAI_RESPONSE_STATE_MODE=server` is an OpenAI-only explicit opt-in and requires
`OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=true`. A completed assistant Response id is stored in the
same SQLite transaction as the exact assistant-message id it represents. The id
is reused only when that assistant is still the latest assistant, exactly one
new user message follows it, and the anchor is no older than 55 minutes. Every
other case cold-starts from SQLite. Missing provider state also cold-replays the
exact active turn. The `compatible` profile assumes no server-side response
state and therefore requires `stateless`; startup rejects the server-state
combination.

## Compatible-profile client tool search and local parallel batch

The `compatible` profile runs client-executed `tool_search`. Deferred tool schemas
remain in an immutable per-turn local index built from the exact inventory
already filtered for the current notification lane and configured integrations.
The first request carries only always-on tools plus a strict client-search
descriptor. A valid `tool_search_call` is answered with a linked
`tool_search_output` using the exact `call_id` and at most eight full trusted
specifications. Discovery is bounded by newly exposed canonical work rather
than a four-call cliff: at most 80 unique functions, 32 namespaces, and 96 KB
of UTF-8 schema definitions may be added during one root turn. A provider
response may contain at most four search calls, and the normal 40-iteration
root ceiling still applies. Already exposed functions are removed before the
linked output is built, so overlapping searches add only bounded call/output
metadata instead of repeating full schemas. Registry validation and the three
work ceilings are checked atomically before any definition is committed.
Missing, duplicate, mixed, conflicting, malformed, or over-budget search
responses fail closed with a sanitized diagnostic. OpenAI retains its hosted
tool-search path unchanged.

The `compatible` profile assumes no hosted Programmatic Tool Calling. EVE
therefore never sends `programmatic_tool_calling` to such an endpoint,
even if the hosted feature flag is set. Its local `local_parallel_batch` is a
declarative bounded substitute, not a JavaScript runtime: it accepts one to four
unique calls from the existing nine public-read facade names, validates the
entire batch and all arguments before egress, then runs them concurrently with
stable result ordering. Private ESI, raw SQL, web search, writes, UI operations,
monitors, recursion, dynamic code, `eval`, subprocesses, and result-directed
follow-up are not representable. Per-tool schemas and size caps still apply;
raw upstream failures are replaced by fixed local error contracts.

Every root turn also owns an effective tool registry. It starts with exactly
the function definitions sent in the current request and may grow only from
canonical definitions returned by the trusted local client-tool-search index.
All calls are JSON-Schema validated against that registry before policy lookup,
admission, deduplication, or dispatch. Unloaded names, forged schemas, malformed
JSON, duplicate call IDs, extra properties, and unsupported schema constructs
fail closed without tool or network execution.

When `CHEAPVIBE_READ_SUBAGENTS_ENABLED=true`, either provider profile can issue
one `delegate_read_subagents` call containing two or three independent public
research jobs. These are application-managed stateless Responses calls through
the same selected provider adapter, not provider-native agents. Each worker gets
only its objective and a private effective registry assembled from the exact
allowlisted subset of the nine public facade tools. It gets no conversation
history, profile, character identity, private ESI data, tokens, route tools,
writes, UI actions, or delegation tool. Workers cannot recurse. Results use
all-settled semantics and return in stable job order so a failed sibling cannot
erase successful evidence; the root model alone writes the user-facing answer.
The `compatible` profile enables this path by default; `openai` keeps it
default-off but uses the same application coordinator when explicitly enabled.

The coordinator is intentionally narrow: use it for two or three independent,
bounded public reads whose overlap saves latency. Simple chat, a single read,
dependent lookups, private data, route mutation, autopilot, monitor control, and
all other side effects remain in the root loop. One turn permits at most one
delegated batch, three concurrent workers, six subagent model calls, 24 shared
root/delegated read leaves, and four iterations per worker. Subagent evidence is
schema-checked, size-bounded, and treated as untrusted data; instructions found
inside tool output never gain authority.

The root captures the user, thread/chat lane, active character, granted-scope
fingerprint, locale, and deadline before preflight. It revalidates that durable
identity before model stages and tool dispatch. A character switch, unlink, or
scope change aborts stale work, clears continuation state, and asks the user to
repeat the request for the newly active character. Provider admission and the
new subagent path accept cancellation; queued work is removed and the active
HTTP/SSE provider request is aborted.

## Public multi-user load control

Every accepted chat turn is tied to the resolved internal `user_id` and chat
lane. Thread ownership, linked-character resolution, private ESI credentials,
the local tool-search index, function budgets, and continuation input remain
per turn; none is stored in a shared provider session. Telegram and Discord now
share the same actor guard, so one user cannot run overlapping turns by entering
through two platforms. The public web chat must call the same
`evaluateChatRequestAllowance`, in-flight registration, `runAgentTurn`, and
cleanup path rather than invoking the executor directly.

Provider sampling has a second, process-wide admission layer because internal
compaction/profile calls also consume model capacity. It admits a bounded number
of simultaneous HTTP/SSE Responses, queues excess work FIFO up to a fixed
ceiling, rejects a full queue, and removes timed-out waiters. A release is
idempotent and happens in `finally`, including transport failure. This protects
the event loop, provider connection count, and memory while the existing chat
guard keeps one active turn per user, a global active-turn ceiling, and a
sliding request window.

Leaf tools have their own process-wide admission boundary. Public reads use a
bounded shared pool (`16` active and `64` queued by default); write and UI tools
use one global permit, so state mutations from different users cannot overlap.
The `local_parallel_batch` container deliberately holds no permit while its one
to four children wait for read permits, avoiding semaphore deadlock. Its leaf
calls still count against the global read cap.

Batch facades have a second source-level boundary: nested CCP ESI leaves share
one process-wide pool (`12` active by default). Thus 16 simultaneously admitted
`batch_market_prices` containers cannot expand into 480 simultaneous upstream
requests. The container holds no ESI leaf permit while waiting for its children,
and every acquired leaf permit is released in `finally`.

Defaults are deliberately conservative for one Node.js process and SQLite:

- `OPENAI_MAX_CONCURRENT_RESPONSES=8`
- `OPENAI_MAX_QUEUED_RESPONSES=32`
- `OPENAI_RESPONSE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MS=15000`
- `AGENT_MAX_CONCURRENT_READ_TOOLS=16`
- `AGENT_MAX_CONCURRENT_ESI_LEAVES=12`
- `AGENT_MAX_QUEUED_TOOLS=64`
- `AGENT_TOOL_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MS=15000`
- `TELEGRAM_MAX_ACTIVE_REQUESTS_GLOBAL=8` (shared chat guard despite the
  legacy environment-variable prefix)

Tune these from measured provider latency, open sockets, event-loop delay,
SQLite busy time, memory, and upstream ESI limits. Do not raise the chat ceiling
without also considering that one accepted local batch can fan out to four
bounded public reads and a market facade can fan out only inside the separate
ESI-leaf ceiling. The current single-process runtime lock and SQLite design
mean horizontal multi-instance serving is out of scope until coordination and
database architecture are changed explicitly.

GPT-5.6 `reasoning.context=all_turns` is intentionally not exposed. With `store=false`, correct persisted reasoning requires requesting `reasoning.encrypted_content`, preserving every response output item, and replaying those opaque items in order. The current SQLite history stores user-visible messages and tool audit data, not complete encrypted reasoning items. Sending `all_turns` without that storage path would silently overstate continuity.

Within one active tool loop, the default OpenAI profile requests
`reasoning.encrypted_content` and replays each opaque reasoning item in provider
output order with the corresponding function calls and outputs. These items are
never persisted in SQLite. The `compatible` profile is the explicit exception:
it does not request encrypted reasoning and filters reasoning items while
replaying function calls and outputs. With the default
`OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=false`, the application does not create a stored
Response object for Dashboard Logs; with the OpenAI opt-in enabled, the request
and response are subject to OpenAI's applicable retention policy and may be
visible to the model operator. The OpenAI path preserves same-turn GPT-5.6
reasoning without claiming cross-turn `all_turns` continuity.

## Stored Response Logs

Set `OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=true` only when the self-hosting operator accepts
provider retention of the complete Responses exchange, which can include chat
context, generated programs, function-call arguments, and tool outputs replayed
on later iterations. Stored Responses can be inspected at
<https://platform.openai.com/logs?api=responses>. OpenAI documents a 30-day
[Responses application-state retention period](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/your-data#v1responses)
by default or with `store=true`; an organization or project with Zero Data
Retention treats `store=true` as `false`.

Storage and state continuation are separate controls: `store=true` makes logs
available but only `OPENAI_RESPONSE_STATE_MODE=server` reuses response ids.
SQLite remains the canonical durable conversation history. `previous_response_id`
reduces client replay payloads and simplifies normal tool continuations; it does
not remove prior-chain input from billing. Top-level instructions are still sent
on every request. Prompt caching may reduce repeated-prefix processing, but it is
not conversation memory and usage counters remain authoritative.

Prefix caching on a compatible gateway is not probe-verified.
Treat `cached_tokens` as the runtime billing/latency evidence;
do not infer a cache write from an absent `cache_write_tokens` counter. The app keeps its opaque
`prompt_cache_key` derived per user and never sends a raw user/chat/database ID.

## EVE-KILL MCP Analytics

Full agent turns do not serialize third-party hosted MCP descriptors. Those
turns may contain chat history, linked-character context, profile data, active
fits, and private ESI results. With a direct hosted MCP descriptor, a remote call
can execute before application code receives the model response, so response
validation cannot protect the outbound arguments.

Ordinary EVE-KILL access uses the local `eve_kill` REST function namespace.
`doctrine_detect`, `meta_pulse`, `killmail_forensics`, and `coalition_graph` use
a separate local `eve_kill_analytics` function namespace. The model produces a
strict local function call; application code accepts only public numeric IDs,
canonical date pairs, enums, booleans, and bounded limits, and only then sends a
fixed JSON-RPC `tools/call` request to EVE-KILL MCP. Aggregate-only mode exposes
neither namespace.

The OpenAI request never contains an EVE-KILL hosted MCP descriptor. Application
validation, not prompt policy or a remote allowlist, is the pre-egress privacy
boundary. Rejected analytics arguments are not persisted by value, and remote
error bodies are not exposed to the model or logs.

The streaming fallback follows the official `output_index` ordering and joins
`response.output_item.added` with the documented flat
`response.function_call_arguments.done` fields. Non-2xx provider bodies are
reduced at the transport boundary to HTTP status plus a fixed recovery category;
their raw text never enters an exception or bot log.

Recoverable errors carried in a response envelope are classified before the
generic non-completed-status failure and before any envelope output is processed.
Transient errors retry the same logical request within the existing bound, and
tool-state errors retain bounded cold recovery. Output from an error or otherwise
non-completed envelope is never registered, replayed, budgeted, audited, or
dispatched as a tool call. Unrecoverable envelopes return only the generic safe
model-service failure.

## Compatibility Notes

- The request uses streaming and function tools.
- `prompt_cache_key` is forwarded when available.
- `phase` is preserved on replayed function-call output items instead of being stripped.
- Invalid response-state, reasoning-effort, reasoning-mode, verbosity, and timeout values fail fast at startup rather than becoming a delayed API 400.
- Usage telemetry records `cached_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, and reasoning tokens separately. GPT-5.6 implicit caching remains enabled; explicit cache breakpoints are not part of the baseline migration.
- When `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` is configured, top-level calls send a stable HMAC-derived `safety_identifier`. Raw Telegram, Discord, chat, and database user ids are not sent.
- `OPENAI_RESPONSE_LANGUAGE` is injected into the developer prompt as a dedicated response-language instruction. Use values like `ru`, `русский`, `en`, `English`, or a custom language name.
- The model must not see tokens, refresh flow internals, pagination internals, retries, or secrets; those stay in backend code.

`OPENAI_MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW=200000` is a conservative local compaction budget, not a claim about the selected model's advertised context window. The runtime compacts at 90% of this value and keeps it configurable because maximum input, reserved output, latency, and cost all matter.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
npm run check
npm run smoke
npm run smoke:openai
npm run smoke:eve-tool
```

`npm run check` validates type safety, unit/integration tests, linting, and Responses payload regressions. `npm run smoke` checks required environment variables, the model `/responses` endpoint, and app health.

The authenticated smoke script sends a minimal request to the configured `OPENAI_BASE_URL` over HTTP/SSE, the transport of both profiles. It prints only sanitized endpoint metadata.

`npm run smoke:eve-tool` runs the real agent loop on a copied SQLite database and requires the model to call an EVE SDE tool before returning a final answer. Use `EVE_TOOL_SMOKE_MODE=direct` to validate only the DB-backed tool path without a model call.

## Default-off Programmatic Tool Calling expansion

`OPENAI_PROGRAMMATIC_TOOL_CALLING=false` is the supported baseline and rollback switch. The value is parsed strictly as `true` or `false` (case-insensitive). When enabled, EVE adds one hosted `{type:"programmatic_tool_calling"}` descriptor. The selected OpenAI model, project, and organization must be entitled to the feature; an enabled provider rejection is surfaced through the normal sanitized error boundary and is never retried with the feature silently removed.

The exact programmatic allowlist has nine names:

1. `count_universe_objects`
2. `batch_market_prices`
3. `compare_wormhole_types`
4. `scout_systems`
5. `kill_activity_summary`
6. `market_history_summary`
7. `system_metric_snapshot`
8. `doctrine_summary`
9. `dynamic_item_summary`

All nine remain directly callable. Each advertises
`allowed_callers:["direct","programmatic"]` and a fixed `output_schema` only
while the feature is enabled; nested Scout tools retain that decoration after
tool search. Eligibility is by exact function name, not namespace, source,
read-only classification, prefix, or input shape. EVE validates caller linkage,
inputs, work units, family coherence, and serialized outputs again before
dispatch or external egress. Provider schemas and prompt text are
interoperability aids, not authorization.

The function-input schema sent on the wire intentionally omits `uniqueItems`
for arrays such as market type IDs, wormhole identifiers, system IDs,
dynamic-item attribute IDs, and delegated tool hints because current Responses
implementations reject or stall on that keyword in function parameters. EVE
still rejects duplicates strictly in application validation before any CCP ESI,
EVE-Scout, EVE-KILL, or delegated egress; the constraint is not weakened or
silently normalized.

One program can use only one exact tool name and one bounded comparison shape:

- exactly two independent static counts;
- the same ordered one-to-ten type IDs over two-to-four market regions;
- one facade call comparing two-to-eight wormhole identifiers;
- two-to-four distinct Scout system searches with at most ten rows each;
- two-to-four explicit public kill summaries over distinct targets or
  non-overlapping windows of at most seven days and at most five evidence IDs;
- two-to-four distinct market-history `(region_id,type_id)` pairs using the
  same 30-day or 90-day window;
- two-to-four distinct system metrics over the exact same ordered one-to-100
  system IDs;
- two-to-four distinct corporation/alliance doctrine targets using the exact
  same explicit window and `top<=5`; or
- two-to-four distinct dynamic `(type_id,item_id)` pairs using the exact same
  ordered one-to-ten requested attribute IDs.

Names and numeric IDs are resolved directly before the program starts. A
single lookup stays direct. Programs cannot retry, loop, discover IDs, call a
raw backing operation, or mix families.

The four added direct facades are deliberately narrower than their backing
operations:

- `market_history_summary` accepts one positive region/type pair and `days` of
  30 or 90, then returns aggregate price, volume, volatility, and liquidity
  evidence without daily rows;
- `system_metric_snapshot` accepts one of `kills`, `jumps`, `industry`, or
  `sovereignty` plus one-to-100 unique ordered system IDs, then returns exactly
  one compact typed row per requested ID;
- `doctrine_summary` accepts one public corporation/alliance ID, an explicit
  canonical window of at most 366 days, and `top` from one to ten, then returns
  validated non-authoritative loss-fit inference without raw analytics; and
- `dynamic_item_summary` accepts one exact type/item pair and one-to-20 unique
  ordered attribute IDs, then returns only those numeric values plus optional
  local-SDE base/delta evidence.

OpenAI's hosted runtime executes generated programs. EVE never evaluates generated JavaScript and executes only returned client-owned function calls. On the OpenAI profile, every provider output item (including opaque reasoning, `program`, `program_output`, fingerprints, messages, and callers) is retained in memory for the active turn and replayed in exact provider order, followed by local function outputs in call order. The `compatible` profile filters reasoning items as described above and keeps Programmatic Tool Calling disabled. EVE does not persist program code, fingerprints, encrypted reasoning, or replay payloads in SQLite. When `OPENAI_STORE_RESPONSES=true`, OpenAI may retain those request and response items in its stored Response logs. Mid-turn SQLite compaction is skipped while a program is active because it cannot reconstruct this chain.

The application permits at most four programmatic calls per response batch,
user turn, and program ID. Family work ceilings are 40 region/type pairs for
`batch_market_prices`, 400 examined observations for
`kill_activity_summary`, 360 requested history-days for
`market_history_summary`, 400 requested system rows for
`system_metric_snapshot`, 20 requested doctrine rows for `doctrine_summary`,
and 40 requested dynamic attributes for `dynamic_item_summary`. Duplicate
targets, mismatched ordered ID/attribute sets, mixed history windows, doctrine
windows/tops, repeated metrics, overlapping kill-summary windows, mixed tool
names, malformed calls, and over-budget batches are rejected atomically before
any call in that programmatic batch dispatches. Every eligible result is
schema-validated and serialized as at most 12,000 characters; invalid,
non-finite, drifted, unserializable, or oversized data becomes a schema-valid
fixed error rather than a sliced preview. The existing 16 model-iteration
ceiling remains.

A provider final message is accepted only after every program with accepted
calls has reached its declared minimum shape: two calls for every family except
the one-call bounded wormhole comparison; static count is exactly two. This
remains true even if a later duplicate, incoherent, invalid, or over-budget
batch for that program is rejected. Only a fully rejected program with zero
accepted calls may report its structured rejection without a minimum-shape
obligation. Hosted verification requires an explicit final-assistant event and
recomputes schema validity from each emitted local output. Negative wire
scenarios require a structured rejection with no `tool_start` or dispatch.

All programmatic tools are public reads. Market price/history, system metrics,
and dynamic dogma use unauthenticated CCP ESI; dynamic-item base comparisons may
also read the installed local SDE. Scout results carry third-party provenance
and a fixed 86,400-second cache ceiling. Kill summaries carry third-party
provenance, a 90-second search-cache ceiling, compact aggregates and bounded
evidence IDs only. `doctrine_summary` calls only the fixed local
`doctrine_detect` wrapper, is non-authoritative, and projects at most five
validated rows without URLs, module lists, raw clusters, or transport data.
Dynamic-item output excludes creator identity, effects, and unrequested
attributes; system snapshots exclude the full bulk response; market history
excludes raw daily rows. Programs cannot reach private ESI/capabilities,
`sde_sql`, web/search/browser, routes, raw ESI backing operations, raw kill
arrays/detail, generic EVE-KILL analytics, writes, UI, notes, fits, watches,
monitors, heartbeat, notifications, or any unlisted tool.

Routine audit records and console output for the four new bounded facades
contain only the fixed `bounded-public-read` or `programmatic-bounded`
classification, not argument names, values, or IDs. Programmatic result audit stores only
success/blocked/schema status and output length. Generated program text, caller
IDs, raw arguments, full upstream responses, and credentials are neither
persisted nor logged.

Verification is split by boundary. The public-source matrix calls the bounded
public facades through production executors with the feature disabled. The
hosted matrix covers all nine eligible families plus disallowed, mixed-family,
and over-budget rejection scenarios. Both print sanitized metrics only:
scenario status/category, elapsed time, iteration/token counts when available,
facade names, accepted/rejected counts, work units, output character counts,
final-answer length, and schema status. They never print prompts, arguments,
IDs, names, market/dogma/doctrine/system values, kill evidence, programs/caller
IDs, response bodies, answers, endpoints, or credentials.

```bash
npm run smoke:eve-tool -- --public-source-matrix
OPENAI_PROGRAMMATIC_TOOL_CALLING=true npm run smoke:eve-tool -- --programmatic-matrix
```

Dynamic-item scenarios additionally require `EVE_TOOL_SMOKE_DYNAMIC_SAMPLES`
to contain a local JSON array of two currently valid public samples, each with
positive `type_id`, `item_id`, and the same ordered one-to-ten
`attribute_ids`. Sample IDs remain local operator input and are never printed
or committed. Missing or malformed samples produce an explicit failing
`NOT_RUN` record instead of silently skipping the scenario.

The hosted run requires an existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and feature entitlement
for the configured model/project. A missing credential, provider entitlement,
or public source is `NOT_RUN`/failure evidence, never a passing substitute.
Rollback is still only `OPENAI_PROGRAMMATIC_TOOL_CALLING=false` plus process
restart: the hosted descriptor and programmatic-only decoration disappear, all
nine tools remain directly callable, and no migration, cache deletion, replay
recovery, provider cleanup, remote revocation, or data repair is needed.
